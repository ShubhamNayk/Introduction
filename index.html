                I am currently exploring **web development**, **robotics**, and **electronics**.  
                I have worked on projects like **line follower robots**, **maze solvers**, and using **IR and ultrasonic sensors**.  
                I’m also learning **Data Structures and Algorithms**, **Machine Learning**, and trying to understand  
                concepts like **rotation matrices** and **kinematics**.

                Recently, I have been building a **business-related website** for shopkeepers to track credit and payments.  
                I also experiment with hosting simple **HTML & CSS websites** on GitHub.
